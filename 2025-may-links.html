        <h1 id="may-2025">May 2025</h1>
<p>Time for another monthly post sharing some of the IT discoveries that crossed my path lately.
Below you'll find a mix of articles, links, and resources, some of which tie into my current activities and areas of interest.</p>
<h2 id="some-thoughts">Some thoughts</h2>
<h4 id="ai-and-blog-automation">AI and blog automation</h4>
<p>It's been five years since I started writing these monthly summaries and link aggregations. Some months are leaner than others in terms of shared content, but I often have a wealth of links to share.</p>
<p>I've been thinking about the time I spend copy-pasting links and formatting markdown for these posts. While it's not a major issue, I thought, "Why not automate it?" With the current AI hype, it seemed like a fun side project to experiment with LLMs and implement some automation.</p>
<p>Initially, I considered using Agents, but that quickly felt like overkill for this task. My goal is simple: parse a list of links, extract some basic information from each website, generate an AI-powered description, and compile it into a monthly blog post.
It's definitely not rocket science.</p>
<p>After some back and forth with Cursor and a few fresh starts, I now have a working pre-alpha version. It's far from perfect, but done is better than perfect, right? I plan to share more details once I've polished it up.</p>
<h4 id="creative-coding">Creative Coding</h4>
<p>This month, I had the pleasure of attending <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/creative-coding-amsterdam/events/307702713/">Creative Coding Amsterdam: May Madness @Mollie</a>.
It was an awesome meetup with three inspiring presentations. I was particularly impressed by the creativity on display.</p>
<p>First, <a href="https://tamulaitis.lt/project/dialrhea/"><strong>Giedrius Tamulaitis</strong></a> showcased his "Doom Phone," a wonderfully absurd project where he turned an old rotary phone into a wireless controller for playing Doom.
Then, <a href="https://ma5a.com/"><strong>Masa</strong></a> took us on a journey through his interactive pixel art worlds, sharing the evolution of his charming and creative coding projects.
Finally, <a href="https://piterpasma.nl/"><strong>Piter Pasma</strong></a> dove deep into the beauty and magic of SDFs (Signed Distance Functions) and his "Rayhatcher" algorithm, which creates stunning 3D art with mathematical code.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't have the time or stamina to stay for networking afterward, but I'll plan better for the next one. The event was packed with inspiring ideas, and I'm definitely planning to attend more of these meetups in the future.</p>

<p><em>A snapshot from the first presentation at the Creative Coding Amsterdam meetup, featuring the "Doom Phone." It’s a vintage rotary phone ingeniously rewired to play the classic game Doom—for no practical reason other than pure creative fun.</em></p>
