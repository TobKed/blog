        <h1 id="september-2022">September 2022</h1>
<p>I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.</p>
<h2 id="articles">Articles</h2>
<h3 id="customizing-your-shell"><a href="https://blog.balthazar-rouberol.com/customizing-your-shell.html">Customizing your shell</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>It is very common for programmers to tweak and customize their terminal and shell for hours,
add or write new plug-ins, all in pursuit of the “perfect environment” and an increase of productivity.
Others, on the contrary, avoid tweaking their shell altogether in order to always get the same experience on every machine.</p>

<p>Working on a PR on django/djangoproject.com, a question came up about how to rebase if the GitHub UI doesn't offer exactly what you want:</p>

<h3 id="some-ways-to-get-better-at-debugging"><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/08/30/a-way-to-categorize-debugging-skills/">Some ways to get better at debugging</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought the categorization was a very useful structure for thinking about how to get better at debugging, so I’ve reframed the five categories in the paper into actions you can take to get better at debugging.</p>

<h3 id="why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size"><a href="https://endtimes.dev/why-your-website-should-be-under-14kb-in-size/">Why your website should be under 14kB in size</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What is surprising is that a 14kB page can load much faster than a 15kB page — maybe 612ms faster — while the difference between a 15kB and a 16kB page is trivial.</p>
<p>This is because of the TCP slow start algorithm. This article will cover what that is, how it works, and why you should care. But first we'll quickly go over some of the basics.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Immensely laborious calculations on inferior data may increase the yield from 95 to 100 percent.
A gain of 5 percent, of perhaps a small total.
A competent overhauling of the process of collection, or of the experimental design, may often increase the yield ten- or twelve-fold, for the same cost in time and labor.
To consult the statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post mortem examination.
He can perhaps say what the experiment died of. To utilize this kind of experience he must be induced to use his imagination, and to foresee in advance the difficulties and uncertainties with which, if they are not foreseen, his investigations will be beset.”</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<h3 id="the-productivity-guide-time-management-strategies-that-work"><a href="https://jamesclear.com/productivity">The Productivity Guide: Time Management Strategies That Work</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Let's define productivity. Productivity is a measure of efficiency of a person completing a task. We often assume that productivity means getting more things done each day. Wrong. Productivity is getting important things done consistently. And no matter what you are working on, there are only a few things that are truly important.</p>
<p>Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum speed on everything.</p>

<h3 id="the-ivy-lee-method-the-daily-routine-experts-recommend-for-peak-productivity"><a href="https://jamesclear.com/ivy-lee">The Ivy Lee Method: The Daily Routine Experts Recommend for Peak Productivity</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Lee was a successful businessman in his own right and is widely remembered as a pioneer in the field of public relations. As the story goes, Schwab brought Lee into his office and said,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Show me a way to get more things done.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Give me 15 minutes with each of your executives,” Lee replied.</p>

I, however, learn better from examples, recipes, and narratives.
Although a few good recipes already exist in the docs, I thought I'd also enlist some of the examples I tried out while grokking them.</p>
