# March 2023

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

## Articles

## Productivity

### [What are Self-Sabotaging Habits and How to Fight Them](https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/self-sabotaging-habits/)

> An interesting fact about habits is that it’s a negative art.
> Commonly, you have a better chance of correcting your overall behavior by getting rid of self-sabotaging habits vs. focusing on good habits.

### [Sitting and Standing at Work](https://ergo.human.cornell.edu/CUESitStand.html)

> Sit to do computer work. Sit using a height-adjustable, downward titling keyboard tray for the best work posture, then every 20 minutes stand for 8 minutes AND MOVE for 2 minutes.
> The absolute time isn’t critical but about every 20-30 minutes take a posture break and stand and move for a couple of minutes.\
> Simply standing is insufficient.
> Movement is important to get blood circulation through the muscles. And movement is FREE! Research shows that you don’t need to do vigorous exercise (e.g. jumping jacks) to get the benefits,
> just walking around is sufficient. So build in a pattern of creating greater movement variety in the workplace (e.g. walk to a printer, water fountain, stand for a meeting, take the stairs,
> walk around the floor, park a bit further away from the building each day
