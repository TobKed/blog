# Packing - what is the problem here?

From time to time I travel. Usually not very often, usually not very far.
And always struggle with the same major problem: packing.
Should I take theese things, maybe I took to much other things.
I try to recall what I took last time when I went to similar trip, and what I forogotten to take.
Even if I consolidated all necessary stuff there is always same minor scratch.
A pair of sunglasses during sunny festival morning or lightweight sitting mat during hiking
are not necessary but are nice to have.
Nice to have, but easy to forget last minute packing when the vast cagnitive resources are spoent on the remembering
more important stuff to take.

I started to preparing paper lists somee time before, and it worked very good.
I had some additional time to think about it before.
I offload storing this list to the paper and crossing out items from it is fun.

But I had to prepare this list again and again every time.
Easy peasy, I have reuse same lists and improve them thorugh iterations.
I am experimenting with different notes taking systems and I am testing Notion
so it was obvious choice. I cam up with the way how to solve.
It may be not the best one but it works for me and If someone have other way
of doing this kind of lists I am happy to learn about it.
