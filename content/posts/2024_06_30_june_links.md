# June 2024

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

This month, I tackled the [Introduction to Generative AI Learning Path on Google Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/118)
This path provided a good foundation for understanding generative AI concepts, ranging from the core workings of large language models to the crucial principles of responsible AI development.

The hands-on labs were particularly insightful, showcasing how to leverage the power of Google services to put theory into practice.
You can see my progress on my Cloud Skills Boost profile [Cloud Skills Boost profile](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/102aba17-a972-4e32-865b-0e3626420e5a/badges/9465084).
