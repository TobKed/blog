# June 2024

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

## Articles

### [Three Laws of Software Complexity (or: why software engineers are always grumpy)](https://maheshba.bitbucket.io/blog/2024/05/08/2024-ThreeLaws.html)

> I posit that most software engineers (particularly those working on infrastructural systems) are destined to wallow in unnecessary complexity due to three fundamental laws.

### [Essays on programming I think about a lot](https://www.benkuhn.net/progessays/)

> Every so often I read an essay that I end up thinking about, and citing in conversation, over and over again.

### [I asked 100 devs they aren't shipping faster. Here's what I learned.](https://www.greptile.com/blog/100-devs)
