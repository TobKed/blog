# December 2025

Time for another monthly post sharing some of the IT discoveries that crossed my path lately.
Below you'll find a mix of articles, links, and resources, some of which tie into my current activities and areas of interest.

## Some thoughts

### AI House: Learning with Google

I recently checked out the [AI House event](https://luma.com/fwnm7zp8), which focused on **getting the most out of AI coding assistants with Google**.
It's fascinating to see how the ecosystem is evolving and how we can leverage these tools more effectively in our daily workflows.
I am currently exploring the **Antigravity** IDE, so it was interesting to get some first-hand tips straight from Google.

### Tool [pvolok/mprocs](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs)

> TUI for running multiple processes

I found this nifty tool for managing development environments where you need to run several commands simultaneously—like backend servers, frontend builders, and watchers—within a single terminal window.

I’ve started using it in my blog's Makefile to run the server and handle content hot-reloading, which makes local debugging much smoother.
