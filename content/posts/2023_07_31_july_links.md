# July 2023

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

Summer is in full swing, and I'm not doing much after work.
Not doing much on the computer, that is. I'm doing a lot of other things, like swimming, hiking, and spending time with friends and family.

But even though I'm not spending a lot of time on the computer, I'm still learning new things.
In work, I've been learning a lot about Kubeflow Pipelines and how to use them to build ML pipelines.

Kubeflow Pipelines are an open-source platform for building and managing ML pipelines.
It's a powerful tool that can help you automate your ML workflow and make it more reproducible.
I've been able to build a few pipelines using Kubeflow Pipelines, and I'm really excited about the possibilities.

I run production pipelines on Google Cloud in a service called Vertex Pipelines.
Vertex Pipelines are a managed service that makes it easy to run Kubeflow Pipelines on Google Cloud.

I'm excited to continue learning about Kubeflow Pipelines and Vertex Pipelines.
I think these are great tools that can help ML engineers automate their workflows and make their work more reproducible.

I'm looking forward to learning more about it, and I will share more about my experiences with these tools in future blog posts.
