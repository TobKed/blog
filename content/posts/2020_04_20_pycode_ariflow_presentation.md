# Airfow workflows in 5 minutes

In October 2019 I've participated PyCode Conference. 
It is an IT conference related to my beloved Python language which takes place in beautiful city Gda≈Ñsk.
During this time I was contributing to Apache Airflow which is the open source workflow management platform. 
I wanted to share my knowledge about this interesting project and I gave short lightning talk about it.
It was my first speech at IT conference and if public speaking would be not enough scary, I performed it in English.
