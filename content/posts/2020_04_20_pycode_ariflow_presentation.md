# Airfow workflows in 5 minutes

I participated in a PyCode Conference in October 2019.
It is a cyclical IT conference related to my beloved Python language which takes place in the beautiful city of Gda≈Ñsk.
During this time I was contributing to Apache Airflow which is the open source workflow management platform. 
I wanted to share my knowledge about this interesting project so I gave a short lightning talk about it.
It was my first speech at a conference and if public speaking wasn't scary enough, I had to perform it in English.
Nevertheless, I survived this experience. Here is the proof :)
