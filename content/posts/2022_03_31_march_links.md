# March 2022

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

## Articles

### [The Thirty Minute Rule](https://daniel.feldroy.com/posts/thirty-minute-rule)

> The rule is that if anyone gets stuck on something for more than 30 minutes, they should ask for help.

### [A Slightly Advanced Introduction to Vim](https://linuxgazette.net/152/srinivasan.html)

> This is not a five minute introduction to vim for a complete newbie. I presume you have used vim before and are comfortable with moving around, and making changes. Although :vimtutor is not a prerequisite to this tutorial, I highly recommend it.
>
> This document contains some mnemonics, and some slightly advanced features of vim that can help the average vim user/programmer increase his/her productivity by leaps and bounds.

### [Scaling Django with Postgres Read Replicas](https://andrewbrookins.com/python/scaling-django-with-postgres-read-replicas/)

> Replication is a feature of PostgreSQL that you typically use to achieve high availability by running copies of a database that are ready to take over if your primary database fails. However, you can also use replication to make your Django applications faster. In this post, I’ll explain how to configure Django to query read-only Postgres replicas, allowing you to scale your database read performance linearly with the number of replicas.

### [How to design better APIs](https://r.bluethl.net/how-to-design-better-apis#heading-2-use-iso-8601httpsenwikipediaorgwikiiso8601-utc-dates)

## Python

### [Mocking in Python Has Never Been Easier](https://peterkogan.medium.com/mocking-in-python-has-never-been-easier-5f9b15e1498f)

> The Pytest Mock Generator library simplifies writing the ‘arrange’ and ‘assert’ sections. It generates the ‘arrange’ and ‘assert’ sections for you and allows you to focus on the ‘act’ section of your tests.

### [How and why I use pytest's xfail](https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/11/pytest-xfail.html)

> xfail vs skip
>
> The main difference is that with skip you don't run the test at all, whereas with xfail, you run the test and make sure that it failed (if it doesn't fail, it's marked as XPASS)

### [Modern Python Environments - dependency and workspace management](https://testdriven.io/blog/python-environments/)

> Once you get through the pain of setting up a Python environment for a single "hello world"-esque application, you'll need to go through an even more difficult process of figuring out how to manage multiple environments for multiple Python projects.

### [How to Write User-friendly Command Line Interfaces in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-write-user-friendly-command-line-interfaces-in-python-cc3a6444af8e)

> The first step to make people love your application.
