# August 2023

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

With the summer season in full force and plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy, there's also exciting news!
A new tutorial is coming soon that will teach you how to use FastAPI, CloudRun, and PubSub for message queueing.
This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up your environment, creating API and worker services, and deploying them to CloudRun.
By the end of the tutorial, you'll have a working FastAPI application that can handle requests and push messages to a PubSub topic, along with a worker service that can process messages.
Stay tuned for more details!
