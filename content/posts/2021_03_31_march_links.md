> Phones in 2007 had the same features as the iPhone. The Palm Treo even had a touch screen. The difference was speed.

### [Elegant bash conditionals](https://timvisee.com/blog/elegant-bash-conditionals/)

> – Nie ma co ukrywać, że praca zdalna potrafi rozleniwić i można stać się zbytnim domownikiem, co mi też zdarzyło się w pewnym okresie życia. Skoro można pracować z łóżka to po co z niego wstawać, po co przebierać się z piżamy, skoro całą dobę można spędzić w sypialni. A jak już człowiek jest cały dzień w piżamie, to przecież nie wyjdzie na zakupy, ani na siłownie, ani do ludzi – powiedział nam Grzegorz Krukowski, Programista z 15-letnim doświadczeniem.

## Python

### [syntactic sugar](https://snarky.ca/tag/syntactic-sugar/)

> "In computer science, syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer." 
>   -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar

> In a supply chain attack, the crooks don’t break into your network and install the malware directly.

## Other stuff

### [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)

>  Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well—usually programs they wrote themselves—and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes.
> 
> Our goal is to change that. In these two books, the authors of four dozen open source applications explain how their software is structured, and why. What are each program's major components? How do they interact? And what did their builders learn during their development? In answering these questions, the contributors to these books provide unique insights into how they think.
> 
> If you are a junior developer, and want to learn how your more experienced colleagues think, these books are the place to start. If you are an intermediate or senior developer, and want to see how your peers have solved hard design problems, these books can help you too.
