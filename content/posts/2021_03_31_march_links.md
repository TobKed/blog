Summary: Interesting stuff from the month
Status: published


# March 2021

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.


## Some thoughts

The main event of the month was the **[Poductivity step by step (PL: Produktywność krok po kroku)](https://produktywnosckrokpokroku.pl/)** course.
I wrote more about it in a separate post: [Productivity course]({filename}/posts/2021_04_15_productivity.md)

> – Nie ma co ukrywać, że praca zdalna potrafi rozleniwić i można stać się zbytnim domownikiem, co mi też zdarzyło się w pewnym okresie życia. Skoro można pracować z łóżka to po co z niego wstawać, po co przebierać się z piżamy, skoro całą dobę można spędzić w sypialni. A jak już człowiek jest cały dzień w piżamie, to przecież nie wyjdzie na zakupy, ani na siłownie, ani do ludzi – powiedział nam Grzegorz Krukowski, Programista z 15-letnim doświadczeniem.

### [Czy Developer może zostać DevOpsem? Historia Mateusza Lubańskiego](https://geek.justjoin.it/czy-developer-moze-zostac-devopsem-historia-mateusza-lubanskiego)

> Mateusz po blisko sześciu latach pracy na stanowisku Backend Developera został DevOpsem. Nie była to łatwa decyzja, bo w organizacji, w której pracował, był pierwszą osobą na tym stanowisku. Brakowało więc wypracowanej kultury DevOpsa, a przede wszystkim świadomości współpracowników, w jaki sposób może im pomóc rozwiązywać problemy. O pracy DevOpsa rozmawialiśmy z Mateuszem Lubański, DevOps & Software Engineer w ICE Mortage Technology.

### [What a Year of WFH Has Done to Our Relationships at Work ](https://hbr.org/2021/03/what-a-year-of-wfh-has-done-to-our-relationships-at-work)

> More than a year into the Covid-19 pandemic and WFH, new research from Microsoft shows that employees and teams are becoming much more siloed. In particular, connections with people outside our immediate teams has shrunk dramatically, leading to fewer places to connect around innovative ideas and fewer opportunities to build social capital. Further, this trend is making employees feel lonely and isolated. To help address this issue, leaders should focus on being proactive about connecting employees across the organization, make space for connections outside official meetings, encourage and reward social support, and improve the structure of meetings.

### [10 Infographics That Make You More Productive at Work](https://blog.weekdone.com/10-infographics-that-make-you-more-productive-at-work/)

> “Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work,” wrote Stephen King.

## Python

### [syntactic sugar](https://snarky.ca/tag/syntactic-sugar/)

> "In computer science, syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer." 
>   -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar 

### [Poison packages – “Supply Chain Risks” user hits Python community with 4000 fake modules](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2021/03/07/poison-packages-supply-chain-risks-user-hits-python-community-with-4000-fake-modules/)

> In a supply chain attack, the crooks don’t break into your network and install the malware directly.
> Instead, they insert their malware upstream from you, implanting it into someone else’s network, repository or delivery mechanism and waiting for the infection to pass down the chain until it reaches you.

### [Pattern matching tutorial for Pythonic code](https://mathspp.com/blog/pydonts/pattern-matching-tutorial-for-pythonic-code)

### [Writing tests for the Django admin with pytest-django](https://til.simonwillison.net/django/testing-django-admin-with-pytest)

> Using the admin_client fixture.

### [Five Common Django Mistakes](https://www.laac.dev/blog/five-common-django-mistakes/)

## Other stuff

### [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html)

>  Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well—usually programs they wrote themselves—and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes.
> 
> Our goal is to change that. In these two books, the authors of four dozen open source applications explain how their software is structured, and why. What are each program's major components? How do they interact? And what did their builders learn during their development? In answering these questions, the contributors to these books provide unique insights into how they think.
> 
> If you are a junior developer, and want to learn how your more experienced colleagues think, these books are the place to start. If you are an intermediate or senior developer, and want to see how your peers have solved hard design problems, these books can help you too.

### [Why All My Servers Have an 8GB Empty File](https://brianschrader.com/archive/why-all-my-servers-have-an-8gb-empty-file/)

> On Linux servers it can be incredibly difficult for any process to succeed if the disk is full. Copy commands and even deletions can fail or take forever as memory tries to swap to a full disk and there's very little you can do to free up large chunks of space. But what if there was a way to free up a large chunk of space on disk right when you need it most? Enter the dd command.
