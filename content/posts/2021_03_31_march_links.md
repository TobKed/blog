> – Nie ma co ukrywać, że praca zdalna potrafi rozleniwić i można stać się zbytnim domownikiem, co mi też zdarzyło się w pewnym okresie życia. Skoro można pracować z łóżka to po co z niego wstawać, po co przebierać się z piżamy, skoro całą dobę można spędzić w sypialni. A jak już człowiek jest cały dzień w piżamie, to przecież nie wyjdzie na zakupy, ani na siłownie, ani do ludzi – powiedział nam Grzegorz Krukowski, Programista z 15-letnim doświadczeniem.

## Python

### [syntactic sugar](https://snarky.ca/tag/syntactic-sugar/)

> "In computer science, syntactic sugar is syntax within a programming language that is designed to make things easier to read or to express. It makes the language "sweeter" for human use: things can be expressed more clearly, more concisely, or in an alternative style that some may prefer."

> In a supply chain attack, the crooks don’t break into your network and install the malware directly.
> Instead, they insert their malware upstream from you, implanting it into someone else’s network, repository or delivery mechanism and waiting for the infection to pass down the chain until it reaches you.
