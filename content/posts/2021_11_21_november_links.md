Summary: Interesting stuff from the month
Status: draft


# November 2021

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.


## Some thoughts

Despite of the fact that most of the month I was sick in my overheated head arose idea to finally learn Vim.
I decided Moving beyond moving upd and down and at least trying to understand how people are using on the daily basis, why it so popular.
Comments like "learning vim is the second most significant skill after reading" makes you think.

### [The Duct Tape Programmer](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/09/23/the-duct-tape-programmer/)

> Jamie Zawinski is what I would call a duct-tape programmer. And I say that with a great deal of respect. He is the kind of programmer who is hard at work building the future, and making useful things so that people can do stuff. He is the guy you want on your team building go-carts, because he has two favorite tools: duct tape and WD-40. And he will wield them elegantly even as your go-cart is careening down the hill at a mile a minute. This will happen while other programmers are still at the starting line arguing over whether to use titanium or some kind of space-age composite material that Boeing is using in the 787 Dreamliner.
