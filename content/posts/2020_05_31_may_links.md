# May 2020

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.


## Some thoughts

This month I managed to improve caching of the company website while also working on its CI/CD pipeline.
Then I started to work on building python wheels on GitHub Actions for an Open Source project which occupied me in the last days of the month. 
Meanwhile I also investigated caching in an internal Django-based project and continued learning about core infrastructure and services of Google Cloud Platform on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) and [Qwiklabs](https://www.qwiklabs.com/) platforms.
