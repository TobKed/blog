# May 2023

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

Last month was intensive with Google Cloud-related stuff.
I heavily used Cloud Run and was able to create a pretty robust and scalable system, which also includes PubSub and Cloud SQL.
But the most exciting thing for me was learning [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/), which is a GitOps tool that automatically keeps the Kubernetes cluster in sync with the source of configuration (git, of course).
[Flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/) can not only scan for changes in configuration files but also periodically check if a newer Docker image has become available and update the respective configuration files and cluster accordingly.
It is an amazing tool, and it was a pleasure to learn it.
I am extremely excited to use it in my pet projects.
