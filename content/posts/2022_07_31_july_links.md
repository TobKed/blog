# July 2022

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

My article was published in PyCoders weekly, awesome! And in Django Newsletter

## Articles

### [Why new Macs break your Docker build, and how to fix it](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-build-problems-mac/)

> Tt can be a little confusing when you try to build your Python-based Dockerfile on a new Mac, and everything starts failing. What used to work before—on an older Mac, or on a Linux machine—fails in completely unexpected ways.

### [3 Design Patterns Every Developer Should Learn](https://blog.bitsrc.io/3-design-patterns-every-developer-should-learn-71a51568ac9d)

> Design patterns are high-level answers to problems that we as software engineers encounter frequently. It isn’t code — I repeat, IT IS NOT CODE. It’s akin to explaining how to approach these issues and come up with a solution.

### [Shipping to Production](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/shipping-to-production/)

> How you ship your code to production in a way that is fast and reliable, is a question more engineers and engineering leaders should educate themselves on. The teams and companies that can do both – ship quickly / frequently and with good quality – have a big advantage over competitors who struggle with either constraint.

### [10 Books Every Senior Engineer Should Read](https://semaphoreci.medium.com/10-books-every-senior-engineer-should-read-a61c1917e2a7)

> Engineers are natural readers. They take enormous pleasure in learning about new things, and books are the perfect medium to cover complex ideas in depth.

### [Monitoring tiny web services](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/07/09/monitoring-small-web-services/)

> I’m not going to talk about how to monitor Big Serious Mission Critical websites at all, only tiny unimportant websites.

### [Luke Smith: The hardest technical solutions are right in front of your face](https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/obvious-technical-solutions/)

> Since I was recently doing tutorials on Hugo, a static site generator, it’s funny to think that through the 90’s, no one really thought to invent a computationally simple static-site generator as they exist now. People moved pretty much directly from manually edditing HTML files manually into massive proprietary WYSIWYG editors and web “frameworks” that regenerate web pages on every single visit.
>
> This lack of vision and inability to see the simpler solution has largely produced the slow-loading, content-minimal web of today and the bizarre culture of modern “webdevs” whose diets consist in anti-patterns.

## Python

### [6 Usage Patterns for the ThreadPoolExecutor in Python](https://superfastpython.com/threadpoolexecutor-usage-patterns/)

### [Don't let dicts spoil your code](https://roman.pt/posts/dont-let-dicts-spoil-your-code/)

> How often do your simple prototypes or ad-hoc scripts turn into fully-fledged applications?
>
> The simplicity of organic code growth has a flip side: it becomes too hard to maintain. The proliferation of dicts as primary data structures is a clear signal of tech debt in your code. Fortunately, modern Python provides many viable alternatives to plain dicts.

### [Apache Airflow in 2022: 10 Rules to Make It Work](https://towardsdatascience.com/apache-airflow-in-2022-10-rules-to-make-it-work-b5ed130a51ad)

### [The Untold Stories of Open Source - The Business Side of Open Source, with Patrick Debois](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/lf-podcast/blob/main/docs/podcasts/business-of-open-source.mdx)

> The first time Patrick Debois came into contact with Open Source was in the early stages of development of the Linux kernel, compiling it on floppies on his 486 machine. To tell you how long ago that was, the Intel 486 was introduced in 1989, It was the first chip in the line to include a built-in math coprocessor.
>
> Patrick was an early adopter of computers, but one thing he missed was a community. In those days he had to copy software over electronic bulletin board systems. But with the Linux kernel, he found it amazing that you could just get it on a cd-rom and pass it around to friends.
>
> From the Linux Foundation office in New York City, this is "The Untold Stories of Open Source". Each week we choose an open source project or a person behind a popular open source initiative, to uncover the untold stories and details about major open source initiatives. If you work with open source, and you do whether you know it or not, you're in the right place.
