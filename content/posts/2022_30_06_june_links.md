# June 2022

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

## Articles

## Python

### [Format Specification Mini-Language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-specification-mini-language)

> “Format specifications” are used within replacement fields contained within a format string to define how individual values are presented (see Format String Syntax and Formatted string literals).

### [Format String Syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax)

> The syntax is related to that of formatted string literals, but it is less sophisticated and, in particular, does not support arbitrary expressions.

### [Formatted string literals](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#f-strings)

> A formatted string literal or f-string is a string literal that is prefixed with 'f' or 'F'. These strings may contain replacement fields, which are expressions delimited by curly braces {}. While other string literals always have a constant value, formatted strings are really expressions evaluated at run time.
