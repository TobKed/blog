# 2024

This year was filled with learning and growth in several key areas.

## AI

In 2024, I went deep into the AI realm, experimenting with tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude AI. Among these, Claude AI best met my needs.
I used NotebookLM to create a year-end summary podcast, which you can find at the end of this post.
I also came across [fabric](https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric), an open-source framework designed to augment human capabilities using AI.

## Presentations

This year, I had the opportunity to give two presentations during internal tech meetups:

- ML (Fast)API below 100ms (on GCP)
- git fixup: Make rewriting history great again

## Certificates

I earned two certifications this year.
First, I became a certified [GitHub Actions](https://www.credly.com/badges/6b96a6c9-28cb-47dd-9dfa-13dd7a37d543) expert, a proud achievement after mastering the tool.
Second, I validated my five-year experience with Terraform by passing th e[HashiCorp Certification: Terraform Associate (003)](https://www.credly.com/badges/dd230996-5592-4397-9dab-02a5144111b9/public_url) exam.

## Photoblog

After these accomplishments, I decided to create a personal project: a photoblog.
I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and GitHub Actions to create the blog, keeping the source code in a private repository to maintain the privacy of the original-size photos and their metadata.
My photoblog is now available for viewing at [photos.tobked.dev](https://photos.tobked.dev).
More about it in [September Summary]({filename}/posts/2024_09_30_september_links.md)

## Productivity by Heart

I also completed the [Productivity By Heart](https://www.productivitybyheart.com/) course, which brought back the creativity spark I felt I had lost.
This course offered a fresh perspective on productivity and has been a game-changer for me.

## Writing

As always, I've kept up with my monthly summaries, where I compile a few sentences about each month, along with any interesting articles, tools, and other materials I've come across.
Each month, I also add a personal touch with a photo I've taken.

## Summary

2024 was an intensive year, but I've learned a lot. I've compiled my reflections on the year in a podcast, which you can listen to below.
