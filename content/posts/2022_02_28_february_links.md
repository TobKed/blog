# February 2022

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

## Articles

## Python

### [cmd](https://docs.python.org/3/library/cmd.html#module-cmd)

## Django

## Python libraries

## Django libraries

## Tools

### [Lurnby](https://github.com/Roznoshchik/Lurnby)

## Other stuff

### [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)

> Classes teach you all about advanced topics within CS, from operating systems to machine learning, but there’s one critical subject that’s rarely covered, and is instead left to students to figure out on their own: proficiency with their tools. We’ll teach you how to master the command-line, use a powerful text editor, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more!
