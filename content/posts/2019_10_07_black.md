## Author

The author of **Black** is Łukasz Langa, a Pythonista from Białystok, Poland.
He is a Python core developer and Python 3.8 release manager.

## Black

A PEP-8 is just a style guide so there are many ways to format the same part of the code and all of them are correct.

```python
class GoogleCloudBaseHook(BaseHook):
    def __init__(self, gcp_conn_id: str = 'google_cloud_default', delegate_to: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
        pass
        
class GoogleCloudBaseHook(BaseHook):
    def __init__(self,
                 gcp_conn_id: str = 'google_cloud_default',
                 delegate_to: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
        pass

class GoogleCloudBaseHook(BaseHook):
    def __init__(
        self,
        gcp_conn_id: str = 'google_cloud_default',
        delegate_to: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
        pass

class GoogleCloudBaseHook(BaseHook):
    def __init__(
        self,
        gcp_conn_id: str = 'google_cloud_default',
        delegate_to: Optional[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        pass
```

Linters give information which part of the code violates PEP-8, but they do not give any solutions.
Usually it is quite easy to fix, but it is annoying and time-consuming.
Also, the chosen code style leaves space for opinionated discussions which may be avoided.
A good code formatter can eliminate it.

> Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter. By using it, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting. In return, Black gives you speed, determinism, and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting. You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.

**Black** uses a subset of PEP-8 as a code style. When this code style was built every decision was preceded by discussion, supported by solid arguments and concrete parts of PEP-8.
Under the hood the code is parsed to Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) so when the file is parsed, the code behaviour remains exactly the same. You can learn more about these concepts from sources listed at the end of text.

#### Pros:

- Fast.
- Deterministic.\
  _When run multiple times, result is always the same._

* Saves time during code review.\
  _No more discussions about where the line should be broken._
* Code reading is easier.\
  _As Uncle Bob said, code is read ten times more often than written. Due to this fact, when code is styled in a consistent way (
  and Black provides consistent output) it minimizes effort while reading it. You can fully focus on syntax and logic and not on style._
* No additional (unneseccary?) refactoring during coding.\
  _During working on some part of code sometimes you may want to change (and sometimes you do it) some adjacent
  areas which are not well formatted (at least you think they are not). Black gets rid off this additional refactors._
* Minimal configuration.

#### Cons:

- Requires Python 3.6+.\
  _Older versions can be formatted but to make it work, the 3.6+ version is required._
- Does not touch strings.\
  _Long strings will never be broken, even if they exceed the line length._
- Does not touch imports.
- Sometimes it is a _PITA_ to configure it with ISORT (which sorts imports).
- Still in beta.

### Using Black

#### Install Black

To use it out of the box:

```bash
pip install black
black {source_file_or_directory}
```

Do you want to format Python by using Python? No problem:

```python
import black

black.format_file_in_place(
    "path/to/file.py,
    mode=black.FileMode(line_length=110),
    fast=False,
    write_back=black.WriteBack.YES,
)
```

<br>

#### pyproject.toml

If you need to change sensible defaults you can do it by defining them in `pyproject.toml` file (this file is described in <nobr>PEP-518</nobr>).

Example `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py37']
include = '\.pyi?$'
exclude = '''

(
  /(
      \.eggs         # exclude a few common directories in the
    | \.git          # root of the project
    | \.hg
    | \.mypy_cache
    | \.tox
    | \.venv
    | _build
    | buck-out
    | build
    | dist
  )/
  | foo.py           # also separately exclude a file named foo.py in
                     # the root of the project
)
'''
```

<br>

#### pre-commit

If you don't use pre-commit in your projects, you should start using it immediately. Pre-commit framework makes configuring
pre-commit hooks pleasant and convenient. The hook for **Black** parses files to be committed and if any of them changed during this parsing, the hook fails and prevents the commit to be successful. It means the code was not compliant with the code style.
The drawback of this is that you have to add formatted files to the staging area and commit them again.

Example `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/ambv/black
    rev: 19.3b0
    hooks:
      - id: black
        name: Formats python files using black
        language_version: python3.6
```

<br>

#### PyCharm/IntelliJ IDE - External Tools

In IDE you can define useful external tools available in `Tools -> External Tool` and under the right-click menu.

![External Tools with Black]({static}/images/posts/2019/black-external-tool.png)

**Install black and locate the installation folder.**

```bash
pip install black
which black
```

**Set External Tool in IDE.**

On macOS:

`PyCharm -> Preferences -> Tools -> External Tools`

On Windows / Linux / BSD:

`File -> Settings -> Tools -> External Tools`

**Click the + icon to add a new external tool.**

Official documentation suggests the following values:

```
Name: Black
Description: Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter.
Program: <install_location>  
Arguments: "$FilePath$"  
```

I personally modified them to better suit my needs:

The version which reads settings from the `pyproject.toml` is the same as above with an additional `Working Directory` property:

```
Working directory: $ProjectFileDir$
```

Version with specific line length:

```
Arguments: "$FilePath$" --line-length 110
```

<br>

#### File-watcher in IDE

Run **Black** on every file save:

Make sure you have the File Watcher plugin installed.
Go to `Preferences or Settings -> Tools -> File Watchers` and click + to add a new watcher:

```
Name: Black
File type: Python
Scope: Project Files
Program: <install_location>
Arguments: $FilePath$
Output paths to refresh: $FilePath$
Working directory: $ProjectFileDir$
Uncheck "Auto-save edited files to trigger the watcher"
```

<br>

### Summary

I hope you will brighten your code with **Black** and make your life easier (and prettier ;) ).
