# September 2024

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

This month I delved deep into the world of [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), a tool that I've grown to love and become an expert in.
Previously I've not only worked extensively with GitHub Actions but also created my own custom actions, such as the [GitHub Forks Sync Action](https://github.com/TobKed/github-forks-sync-action) and the [Label When Approved Action](https://github.com/TobKed/label-when-approved-action).

In addition to this I utilized GitHub Actions for scraping data related to GitHub Actions for the Apache Software Foundation.
This allowed me to calculate valuable statistics.
My dedication to mastering GitHub Actions led me to pass a certification exam with minimal preparation, earning the badge of a certified GitHub Actions expert, which I proudly display [here](https://www.credly.com/badges/6b96a6c9-28cb-47dd-9dfa-13dd7a37d543).

Me a while back, full of hair and excitement, giving a presentation on GitHub Actions:

<img src="{static}/images/posts/2022/2022_10_brival.jpg" alt="Brival Tech Talk - tips & tricks" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

After achieving this milestone, I decided to channel my expertise into a personal project.
One weekend evening I finally created a photoblog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and GitHub Actions.
To maintain the privacy of the original-size photos and their metadata I kept the source code in a private repository.
With the help of a GitHub Actions workflow, a static website was generated using **Hugo** and pushed to a public repository, where my photoblog is now available for viewing at [photos.tobked.dev](https://photos.tobked.dev).

`gh-pages.yaml`

```yaml
name: github pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          submodules: true

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@75d2e84710de30f6ff7268e08f310b60ef14033f  # v3
        with:
          hugo-version: '0.134.3'
          extended: true

      - name: Build
        run: hugo --minify

      - name: Setup Exiftool
        uses: woss/exiftool-action@f592e36cc8d653b8f8ac3084b34403d0911236a3  # v12.87

      - name: Remove Exif data from images
        run: exiftool -r -all= -ext jpg -ext jpeg -ext png -ext webp -overwrite_original public

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@4f9cc6602d3f66b9c108549d475ec49e8ef4d45e  # v4
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/master'
        with:
          deploy_key: ${{ secrets.ACTIONS_PHOTOS_DEPLOY_KEY }}
          external_repository: TobKed/photos
          publish_dir: ./public
          cname: photos.tobked.dev
```

In addition to my GitHub Actions adventures, I also dived into learning tmux, a tool that brought me a lot of joy.
I customized a configuration file to tailor the tmux experience to my liking, enabling features like mouse support and setting new panes to open in the current directory.

`.tmux.conf`

```shell
set -g mouse on
setw -g mode-keys vi

# List of plugins
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tpm'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect'
set -g @plugin 'tmux-plugins/tmux-continuum'

set -g @continuum-restore 'on'

# Set new panes to open in current directory
bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind '"' split-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind % split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
```

I'm excited to share some interesting materials I've gone through. Check them out below.
