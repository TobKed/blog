## Writing

I wanted to improve my writing skills so since March I have been writing monthly summaries where I am trying to compile
a few sentences about the last month together with articles, tools and other interesting materials I came across.

2021 summaries:

- [March]({filename}/posts/2021_01_31_january_links.md)
- [March]({filename}/posts/2021_02_28_february_links.md)
