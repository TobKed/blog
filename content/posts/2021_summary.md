# 2021 # TODO

Yeah, 2021. Give me a break. When you thought 2020 was hard, 2021 hit me so hard Mike Tyson would not be ashamed of these punches.

## Programming journey

#### Apache Beam provider for Apache Airflow

In February, the [Apache Beam provider](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/12814) for [Apache Airflow](https://github.com/apache/airflow)
on which I was working for several weeks was finally merged into `master`.

It is available on pypi:

- [apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam/)
- [apache-airflow-backport-providers-apache-beam](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-backport-providers-apache-beam/)

#### Work

Also in February, the software house Polidea for which I worked was acquired by [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/).
Got an offer and worked there for a few months but I decided to go another way.
I worked for a few months for [Brival](https://www.brival.co/) which is a small software house from Częstochowa where I had a chance to develop the backend for a video-chat self-help plumbing application.

#### Increased Cloud competencies

I continued my journey with Cloud.
In November, I passed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam and got a certificate.
I already have some knowledge about the Google Cloud Platform (Google Cloud Associate Certificate),
so expanding it with another provider gave me a better understanding of the Cloud in general.
I have a better overview of possibilities which Cloud computing offers and feel much more confident in this field.
It is interesting to observe how major players solve the same problems in different ways.

## Learning, talking

I completed the [Productivity course]({filename}/posts/2021_04_15_productivity.md) which helped and continues to help me
improve my time (and life) management.

I also learned how to use this iconic text editor called [Vim](https://www.vim.org/).
Maybe I am not very efficient with it, hence I don’t use it  for everything but comfortable enough to do some work with it.

I gave two presentations:

- Brival Tech Talk: GIT - tips & tricks
- Brival internal talk: Terraform and Google Cloud Platform

## Writing

I wanted to improve my writing skills so since March I have been writing monthly summaries where I am trying to compile
