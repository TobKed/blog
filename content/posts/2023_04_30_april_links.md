### [Saving Energy: Home Server That Automatically Suspends to RAM and Wakes Up Again which is used for Plex media streaming and Time Machine backups.](https://maximiliangolla.com/blog/2022-10-wol-plex-server/)

> It does not sound like much, but running a 24/7 home server that draws 43 watts in idle is quiet expensive, considering the latest electricity prices of about 49 euro cent/kWh here in Germany (as of October, 2022).
> A simple solution to this problem is a script that automatically suspends the server, when it is not used, and another script to wake the server up again, in case there is work to do.
> To my surprise I could not find any out-of-the-box solution, so I thought, it is a worthwhile effort to write about it.
