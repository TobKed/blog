# June 2025

Time for another monthly post sharing some of the IT discoveries that crossed my path lately.
Below you'll find a mix of articles, links, and resources, some of which tie into my current activities and areas of interest.

## Some thoughts

This month was packed with learning, both from books and from the community.

I finally got around to reading ["The Phoenix Project."](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project) It's a novel about IT and DevOps, but it's written more like a thriller, which makes it a really engaging read. It gave me a much better perspective on how development work connects to the larger goals of a business. I highly recommend it if you're interested in seeing the bigger picture and understanding the "why" behind many IT processes.

### [Google Developer Groups: Meet NotebookLM](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/gdg-nl/events/308084364)

I also attended a couple of great local meetups. First, I visited the Google office in Amsterdam for a [Google Developer Groups event on NotebookLM](<(https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/gdg-nl/events/308084364)>). It was insightful to hear Pablo Felip discuss its applications in education. I'm already familiar with the tool, having used it for my [2024 Summary]({filename}/posts/2024_summary.md), so it was great to see other use cases for it.

###[Py.Amsterdam Meetup at Fareharbor](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/pyamsterdam/events/307658391)

Later in the month, the [Py Amsterdam meetup](https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/pyamsterdam/events/307658391) was hosted right at [Fareharbor](https://fareharbor.com/), the company I'm currently working for and enjoying a lot. In the past, it was always quite a trip to get to the meetups, but this time I just grabbed my coffee mug and walked one floor up from my desk to participate in the amazing event. There were three great talks:

- An intro by Ujwaal, the VP of Technology at Fareharbor.
- An inspiring session by Iulia Feroli on building her own, more accurate Spotify Wrapped.
- A very relevant talk by my workmate, Tyrone Damasceno, asking if it's still possible to develop without AI.

The networking afterward was super nice, and I even ran into someone I had met at the Google event earlier in the month.
