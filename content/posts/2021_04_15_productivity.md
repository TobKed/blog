How it started? In March, we "celebrated" one-year anniversary of pandemic in Poland!
An unexpected shift to remote job brought many problems to the table.
One of the most important for me was proper time management and keeping work-life balance.
Natural consequence was reading of numerous articles and blog posts about work from home.
It was not hard to spot common ideas and concepts, like:
 - productivity in general
 - time management (time blocking, time boxing, pomodoro)
 - deep work versus distractions
 - and many, many more

After all I became a little but confused,  so many techniques, so many methodologies, so many tools.
At the end of the day it is not important how much knowledge do you have about productivity, but what was actually done.
I got knowledge, but no reasonable plan of using it.
Which techniques to pick and how to create reliable system for long term maintenance of work and life?

The answer came to me from different podcasts where guests mentioned "productivity step by step" course and how helpful it was to them.
I checked website [produktywnosckrokpokroku.pl](https://produktywnosckrokpokroku.pl/), made some research and signed in for March edition.

March edition? Yes, it is one month course which sounds like a lot of work. Will I have time for it?
Answer is yas. It takes approximately 15 minutes a day, and what is important, EVERY day (weekends are optional).
As the course name says, step by step new things are being uncovered. 
Why it is important? Course it is not only knowledge, but it also helps you build a habit (habits itself are covered in the course as well).
Another benefit of knowledge delivered in small chunks is it leaves space to rethinking it through the day.

What is this course about? It learned me few important things:
 - goals in the order, cleanup organisational mess
 - simple and reasonable planning
 - manage energy, focus and how to fight with distractions
 - proper rest
