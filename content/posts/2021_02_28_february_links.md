Summary: Interesting stuff from the month
Status: published

# February 2021

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

The biggest event of the month is fact that I stared a new job at [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/).

The second highlight of the months is that the [Apache Beam provider](https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/12814) for Apache Airflow on which I was working for several weeks was finally merged into `master`.
Available on pypi:

- [apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-providers-apache-beam/)
- [apache-airflow-backport-providers-apache-beam](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow-backport-providers-apache-beam/)
