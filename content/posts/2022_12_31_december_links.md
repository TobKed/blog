>
> Have you ever wondered why they are always implemented as \[closed, open) as opposed to \[closed, closed\]?

### [Smart Move, Google](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2022-11-24-smart-move-google)

OpenTelemetry is an open source project under the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) that offers a unified framework for generating, collecting and transmitting telemetry data. With OpenTelemetry you can instrument your application in a vendor-agnostic way, and then analyze the telemetry data in your backend tool of choice, whether Prometheus, Jaeger, Zipkin, or others.
