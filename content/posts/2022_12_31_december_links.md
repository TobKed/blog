Status: draft

# December 2022

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

## Articles

### [Do they deserve the gift of your keystrokes?](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/do-they-deserve-the-gift-of-your-keystrokes)

> There are a finite number of keystrokes left in your hands before you die. - Scott Hanselman

### [Moduliths: because we need to scale, but we also cannot afford microservices](https://blog.kronis.dev/articles/modulith-because-we-need-to-scale-but-we-also-cannot-afford-micro-services)

> So, let's get one thing straight: if you're working in ICT, you're probably not in FAANG. Unless you are, in which case, good job at getting there! But for the rest of us, that's somewhat unlikely.

### [Build the modular monolith first](https://www.fearofoblivion.com/build-a-modular-monolith-first)

### [CloudFlare: Using Apache Kafka to process 1 trillion inter-service messages](https://blog.cloudflare.com/using-apache-kafka-to-process-1-trillion-messages/)

> Cloudflare has been using Kafka in production since 2014. We have come a long way since then, and currently run 14 distinct Kafka clusters, across multiple data centers, with roughly 330 nodes. Between them, over a trillion messages have been processed over the last eight years.

### \[Always use [closed, open) intervals](https://fhur.me/posts/always-use-closed-open-intervals)

> ntervals or ranges pop-up everywhere in the programming world. The classic example is picking a start and end date, like you would when booking an AirBnB or a flight. But that's just one example: from slicing a JS Array, to Java's List#sublist and even SQL's LIMIT operator, ranges are everywhere.

> Have you ever wondered why they are always implemented as \[closed, open) as opposed to \[closed, closed\]?
