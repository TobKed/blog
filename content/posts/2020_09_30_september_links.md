Summary: Interesting stuff from the month
Status: published

# September 2020

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

I spent most of the month on holidays. I worked as a server during the 10 day Vipassana meditation retreat. Then I hiked in the Beskid Mountains for a few days.

> Vipassana, which means to see things as they really are, is one of India's most ancient techniques of meditation. It was rediscovered by Gotama Buddha more than 2500 years ago and was taught by him as a universal remedy for universal ills, i.e., an Art Of Living. This non-sectarian technique aims for the total eradication of mental impurities and the resultant highest happiness of full liberation.
