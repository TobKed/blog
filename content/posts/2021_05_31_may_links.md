# May 2021

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.


## Some thoughts

## Articles

### [Use Google like a pro ](https://markodenic.com/use-google-like-a-pro/)

> Googling is one of the most important skills for every developer.

## Python

## Django

### [3 uses for functools.partial in Django](https://adamj.eu/tech/2021/05/05/3-uses-for-functools-partial-in-django)

> Pythonâ€™s functools.partial is a great tool that I feel is underused.

### [Fluent in Django: Get to know Django models better](https://girlthatlovestocode.com/django-model)

> In the introductory Django tutorials, you usually create a Model with few basic fields, you mess with it in the View and show it in a template.
> 
> But Model is and can do so much more. It is the single, definitive source of information about your data. That means that all the logic about your data should be located in the Model (not in View as too often can be seen).
