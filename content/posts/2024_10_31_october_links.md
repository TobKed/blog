# October 2024

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

#### Productivity By Heart

In April 2021, I wrote about the [Productivity Step By Step (Produktywność Krok Po Kroku)](2021_04_15_productivity.md) course by [Piotr Nabielec](https://www.linkedin.com/in/piotrnabielec/).
This time, I completed the [Productivity By Heart](https://www.productivitybyheart.com/) course, and I must say, it brought back the creativity spark I felt I had lost along the way.
The course provided a fresh perspective on productivity and has been a game-changer for me.
You can find my certification of completion [here](https://credsverse.com/credentials/f51a1f4f-dea2-41a0-a661-fd1c110488fe).
I’ll be diving into more details about this course in a separate post after going through all the materials once again.

On another note, I've been enhancing my workflow in the terminal.
I've added some new tools like:

- [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - a command-line fuzzy finder
- [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - a recursive line-oriented search tool
- [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) - an alternative to `find`
