# September 2021

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.


## Some thoughts

## Articles

### [Best practices for writing code comments](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/05/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/)

>  While it's easy to measure the quantity of comments in a program, it's hard to measure the quality, and the two are not necessarily correlated. A bad comment is worse than no comment at all.

### [How to improve your Docker containers security [cheat sheet included]](https://blog.gitguardian.com/how-to-improve-your-docker-containers-security-cheat-sheet/)

> Containers are no security devices. That's why we've curated a set of easily actionable recommendations to improve your Docker containers security.

### [GitHub Actions: Reduce duplication with action composition](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-08-25-github-actions-reduce-duplication-with-action-composition/)

> Previously, actions written in YAML could only use scripts. Now, they can also reference other actions. This makes it easy to reduce duplication in your workflows.

### [Picturing Git: Conceptions and Misconceptions](https://www.biteinteractive.com/picturing-git-conceptions-and-misconceptions)

> There’s an odd thing I’ve noticed about the way many developers use Git. Often, they don’t really have an accurate mental model of what Git is and what it does. It’s surprisingly easy to get used to employing a few basic Git commands without having any real idea of what they mean.

### [Five Ansible Techniques I Wish I’d Known Earlier](https://zwischenzugs.com/2021/08/27/five-ansible-techniques-i-wish-id-known-earlier)

> If you’ve ever spent ages waiting for an Ansible playbook to get through a bunch of tasks so yours can be tested, then this article is for you.

### [Technical documentation writing quick tips](https://marijkeluttekes.dev/blog/articles/2021/09/06/technical-documentation-writing-quick-tips/)

> These are tips that I give colleagues and pupils based on practical experience. Writing is a skill, and people have written entire books about the subject; hence this is a “quick tips” article.

## Python

### [The Unknown Features of Python's Operator Module](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/54)

> At the first glance Python's operator module might not seem very interesting. It includes many operator functions for arithmetic and binary operations and a couple of convenience and helper functions. They might not seem so useful, but with help of just a few of these functions you can make your code faster, more concise, more readable and more functional. So, in this article we will explore this great Python module and make the most out of the every function included in it. 

### [145 Python Projects with Source Code](https://medium.com/coders-camp/130-python-projects-with-source-code-61f498591bb)

> Python is one of the best programming languages. Due to its readability and beginner-friendly nature, it has been accepted by industries around the world. So to master Python for any field you have to work on projects. In this article, I will take you through more than 130 Python projects with source code.

### [Mastering Web Scraping in Python: Scaling to Distributed Crawling ](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/mastering-web-scraping-in-python-scaling-to-distributed-crawling)

### [Writing unit tests for Lambda functions in Python](https://emshea.com/post/writing-python-unit-tests-lambda-functions)

> This post shares what I've learned about writing unit tests for Lambda functions. I'll explain what unit tests are and why they can help you write and make changes to your function code quickly. I've also written an example Python function and unit test (using the unittest framework) so you can see it in practice.

## Django libraries

### [Django cursor pagination](https://github.com/photocrowd/django-cursor-pagination)

> A cursor based pagination system for Django. Instead of refering to specific pages by number, we give every item in the queryset a cursor based on its ordering values. We then ask for subsequent records by asking for records after the cursor of the last item we currently have. Similarly we can ask for records before the cursor of the first item to navigate back through the list.
