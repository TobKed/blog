## Some thoughts

## Articles

### [Best practices for writing code comments](https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/07/05/best-practices-for-writing-code-comments/)

### [Picturing Git: Conceptions and Misconceptions](https://www.biteinteractive.com/picturing-git-conceptions-and-misconceptions)

> There’s an odd thing I’ve noticed about the way many developers use Git. Often, they don’t really have an accurate mental model of what Git is and what it does. It’s surprisingly easy to get used to employing a few basic Git commands without having any real idea of what they mean.

### [Five Ansible Techniques I Wish I’d Known Earlier](https://zwischenzugs.com/2021/08/27/five-ansible-techniques-i-wish-id-known-earlier)

## Python

### [The Unknown Features of Python's Operator Module](https://martinheinz.dev/blog/54)

> At the first glance Python's operator module might not seem very interesting. It includes many operator functions for arithmetic and binary operations and a couple of convenience and helper functions. They might not seem so useful, but with help of just a few of these functions you can make your code faster, more concise, more readable and more functional. So, in this article we will explore this great Python module and make the most out of the every function included in it. 

### [145 Python Projects with Source Code](https://medium.com/coders-camp/130-python-projects-with-source-code-61f498591bb)

> Python is one of the best programming languages. Due to its readability and beginner-friendly nature, it has been accepted by industries around the world. So to master Python for any field you have to work on projects. In this article, I will take you through more than 130 Python projects with source code.

### [Mastering Web Scraping in Python: Scaling to Distributed Crawling ](https://www.zenrows.com/blog/mastering-web-scraping-in-python-scaling-to-distributed-crawling)

> Wondering how to build a website crawler and parser at scale? Implement a project to crawl, scrape, extract content, and store it at scale in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner.

### [How you can track your personal finances using Python](https://sgoel.dev/posts/how-you-can-track-your-personal-finances-using-python/)

> In this post, I'd like to describe how you can track your personal finances using a workflow that is highly focused on data privacy, is 100% self-hosted, and uses only the Python ecosystem.

## Django

### [Python and Django Logging in Plain English](https://djangodeconstructed.com/2018/12/18/django-and-python-logging-in-plain-english/)

> If you’ve ever written a program and printed out a value to see what’s going on during execution, then you understand at some level why logging is so valuable. Knowing what’s happening in your code at a point in time is enormously useful from both technical and business perspectives.

## Python libraries

### [prettymaps](https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps)

> A minimal Python library to draw customized maps from OpenStreetMap data.

## Django libraries

### [Django cursor pagination](https://github.com/photocrowd/django-cursor-pagination)

> A cursor based pagination system for Django. Instead of refering to specific pages by number, we give every item in the queryset a cursor based on its ordering values. We then ask for subsequent records by asking for records after the cursor of the last item we currently have. Similarly we can ask for records before the cursor of the first item to navigate back through the list.

### [DjHTML](https://github.com/rtts/djhtml)

> A pure-Python Django/Jinja template indenter without dependencies.
