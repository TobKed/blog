# June 2020

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.


## Some thoughts

This month I passed an exam and I became a [Google Cloud Associate Engineer](https://www.credential.net/d47b7596-251f-45ac-8a54-4cf6d8c5a286?key=f4eed8bc7e2f25d6b2a9315f31e1a20dd7cd5ecc93caff78eb55feeafcc6be70).
I worked intensively on developing GitHub Actions workflow which builds source distribution and wheels for Python SDK package in Apache Beam project. 
When it is merged then publishing could be done without separate repository beam-wheels. 
It requires changing the release process which is my next goal.
