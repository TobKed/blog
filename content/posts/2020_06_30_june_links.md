Status: draft


# June 2020

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.


## Some thoughts

This month I passed exam and became certified [Associate Cloud Engineer on Google Cloud Platform](https://www.credential.net/d47b7596-251f-45ac-8a54-4cf6d8c5a286?key=f4eed8bc7e2f25d6b2a9315f31e1a20dd7cd5ecc93caff78eb55feeafcc6be70).
I worked intensively on facilitating GitHub Actions to build source distribution and wheels for Python in Apache Beam project.
After that I decreased a bit my time on computer in my spare time to take care of some non-IT related stuff.
