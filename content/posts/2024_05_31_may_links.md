# May 2024

I am aggregating here some more or less interesting stuff of various IT related materials which I came across this month.
Some of them are strictly related to the things I did or am currently doing.

## Some thoughts

This month, I finished the [15 Days of SQL: The Complete SQL Masterclass 2024](https://www.udemy.com/course/15-days-of-sql) course on Udemy 🎉.
It provided a comprehensive introduction to SQL concepts and practices.
The course helped me solidify my foundational knowledge and equip me with additional tools for effective database interaction.
