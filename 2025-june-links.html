    <article>
        <h1 id="june-2025">June 2025</h1>
<p>Time for another monthly post sharing some of the IT discoveries that crossed my path lately.
Below you'll find a mix of articles, links, and resources, some of which tie into my current activities and areas of interest.</p>
<h2 id="some-thoughts">Some thoughts</h2>
<p>This month was packed with learning, both from books and from the community.</p>
<p>I finally got around to reading <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project">"The Phoenix Project."</a> It's a novel about IT and DevOps, but it's written more like a thriller, which makes it a really engaging read. It gave me a much better perspective on how development work connects to the larger goals of a business. I highly recommend it if you're interested in seeing the bigger picture and understanding the "why" behind many IT processes.</p>
<h3 id="google-developer-groups-meet-notebooklm"><a href="https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/gdg-nl/events/308084364">Google Developer Groups: Meet NotebookLM</a></h3>
<p>I also attended a couple of great local meetups. First, I visited the Google office in Amsterdam for a <a href="(https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/gdg-nl/events/308084364)">Google Developer Groups event on NotebookLM</a>. It was insightful to hear Pablo Felip discuss its applications in education. I'm already familiar with the tool, having used it for my <a href="https://blog.tobked.dev/2024-summary">2024 Summary</a>, so it was great to see other use cases for it.</p>

<h3 id="pyamsterdam-meetup-at-fareharbor"><a href="https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/pyamsterdam/events/307658391">Py.Amsterdam Meetup at Fareharbor</a></h3>
<p>Later in the month, the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pl-PL/pyamsterdam/events/307658391">Py Amsterdam meetup</a> was hosted right at <a href="https://fareharbor.com/">Fareharbor</a>, the company I'm currently working for and enjoying a lot. In the past, it was always quite a trip to get to the meetups, but this time I just grabbed my coffee mug and walked one floor up from my desk to participate in the amazing event. There were three great talks:</p>
<ul>
<li>An intro by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ujjwal-tyagi">Ujjwal Tyagi</a>, the VP Engineering at FareHarbor.</li>
<li>An inspiring session by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iuliaferoli/">Iulia Feroli</a> on building her own, more accurate Spotify Wrapped.</li>
<li>A very relevant talk by my workmate, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tyronedamasceno/">Tyrone Damasceno</a>, asking if it's still possible to develop without AI.</li>
</ul>
<p>The networking afterward was super nice, and I even ran into someone I had met at the Google event earlier in the month.</p>

<p>Watch a jazz quartet improvise, and you might think they're making it up as they go. They're not. Every riff builds on practised scales and learned patterns. The constraints don't stifle creativity—they make it work. The same goes for software modelling. Before we get into the chaos of group exercise, we need to have the frame and material to improvise.</p>
</blockquote>

It highlights eight fallacies in this view, emphasizing that AI is transforming the entire system of work, not just individual tasks.
